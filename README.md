# Unfolder
   This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) tool that moves all files from subdirectories to the top level of a directory.
   ## Installation
   To use this tool, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
    Once you have Node.js installed, you can download the tool by cloning this repository or downloading the source code as a ZIP file.
## Usage
   To use the tool, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the tool is installed. Then, run the following command:
    ```
    ./unfolder.js [directoryPath]
    ```
    Replace `[directoryPath]` with the path to the directory you want to move files from. If you don't provide a directory path, the tool will use the current directory.
    The tool will move all files from subdirectories to the top level of the directory. It will output a message for each file that is moved.
